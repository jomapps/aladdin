## 5. Department-to-Department Communication

### 5.1 Communication Protocols

**1. Sequential Dependencies:**
```typescript
// Visual Department waits for Character Department
{
  department: 'visual',
  dependencies: ['character'],
  instructions: 'Create visual concept after character profile available'
}
```

**2. Shared Context:**
```typescript
// Departments access shared project context
const context = await getProjectContext(projectId)
// Returns: { characters, locations, scenes, story, style }
```

**3. Cross-Department Queries:**
```typescript
// Story Department queries Character Department
const characters = await queryDepartment('character', {
  projectId,
  query: 'all protagonists'
})
```

**4. Department Reports:**
```typescript
interface DepartmentReport {
  department: string
  relevance: number
  status: 'not_relevant' | 'complete' | 'pending'
  outputs: DepartmentGrading[]
  departmentQuality: number
  issues: string[]
  suggestions: string[]
}
```

### 5.2 Coordination Patterns

**Pattern 1: Parallel Execution**
```
Departments with no dependencies run simultaneously:
- Character Dept (independent)
- Story Dept (independent)
→ Reduces total execution time
```

**Pattern 2: Sequential Execution**
```
Departments with dependencies run in order:
1. Character Dept creates character
2. Visual Dept uses character for design
3. Image Quality Dept creates references
→ Ensures correct data flow
```

**Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement**
```
Department outputs fed back for improvement:
1. Story Dept creates scene
2. Visual Dept provides feedback
3. Story Dept refines scene
→ Improves final quality
```

## 6. Quality Validation Across Departments

### 6.1 Multi-Level Validation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 1: Specialist Self-Assessment             │
│ - confidence: 0.85                               │
│ - completeness: 0.90                             │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 2: Department Head Grading                │
│ - quality: 0.82                                  │
│ - relevance: 0.88                                │
│ - consistency: 0.79                              │

└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 3: Department Compilation                 │
│ - Average dept quality: 0.81                     │
│ - All outputs accepted                           │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 4: Cross-Department Consistency           │

└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 5: Brain Validation (Neo4j + Embeddings)  │
│ - Semantic consistency: 0.85                     │
│ - Contradiction check: PASS                      │

│ - brainValidated: true → READY FOR INGEST       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.2 Cross-Department Validation

**Consistency Checks:**
```typescript
async function validateCrossDepartment(
  departmentReports: DepartmentReport[]
): Promise<CrossDepartmentValidation> {

  // Check for contradictions between departments
  const contradictions = []

  // Character age vs Story timeline
  const character = getReport('character')
  const story = getReport('story')

  if (character && story) {
    const ageConflict = checkAgeTimeline(
      character.outputs,
      story.outputs
    )
    if (ageConflict) {
      contradictions.push(ageConflict)
    }
  }

  // Visual style vs Character personality
  const visual = getReport('visual')

  if (character && visual) {
    const styleConflict = checkVisualPersonality(
      character.outputs,
      visual.outputs
    )
    if (styleConflict) {
      contradictions.push(styleConflict)
    }
  }

  // Audio voice vs Character profile
  const audio = getReport('audio')

  if (character && audio) {
    const voiceConflict = checkVoiceCharacter(
      character.outputs,
      audio.outputs
    )
    if (voiceConflict) {
      contradictions.push(voiceConflict)
    }
  }

  // Calculate consistency score
  const consistency = contradictions.length === 0
    ? 1.0
    : Math.max(0, 1.0 - (contradictions.length * 0.15))

  return {
    consistent: contradictions.length === 0,
    consistency,
    contradictions,
    suggestions: generateCrossDepartmentSuggestions(contradictions)
  }
}
```

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Parallel Execution Benefits

**Sequential (Without Parallelization):**
```
Character Dept: 15s
Visual Dept: 12s
Audio Dept: 8s
Total: 35 seconds
```

**Parallel (With Parallelization):**
```
Character Dept: 15s |████████████████|
Visual Dept: 12s    |████████████|
Audio Dept: 8s      |████████|
Total: 15 seconds (57% faster)
```

**Within-Department Parallelization:**
```
Sequential Specialists:
Creator: 5s → Stylist: 4s → Designer: 3s = 12s

Parallel Specialists:
Creator: 5s  |█████|
Stylist: 4s  |████|
Designer: 3s |███|
Total: 5s (58% faster)
```

### 7.2 Agent Spawn Optimization

**On-Demand Spawning:**
- Specialists spawned only when needed
- Terminated after task completion
- Reduces resource usage

**Caching:**
- Department heads remain active during session
- Context cached between requests
- Reduces initialization overhead

**Batch Processing:**
- Multiple specialists spawned simultaneously
- Results aggregated in parallel
- Reduces total execution time

### 7.3 Estimated Performance

**Simple Request (1 department, 2 specialists):**
- Total time: 8-12 seconds
- Agent spawns: 3 (1 dept head + 2 specialists)

**Medium Request (2 departments, 6 specialists):**
- Total time: 15-20 seconds
- Agent spawns: 8 (2 dept heads + 6 specialists)

**Complex Request (4 departments, 15 specialists):**
- Total time: 25-35 seconds
- Agent spawns: 19 (4 dept heads + 15 specialists)
