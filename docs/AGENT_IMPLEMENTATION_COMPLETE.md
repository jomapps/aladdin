## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Agent Execution Flow**
```
User Request (Next.js UI)
    ↓
Master Orchestrator (@codebuff/sdk)
    ↓
Department Heads (parallel execution)
    ↓
Specialist Agents (as needed)
    ↓
Custom Tools (queryBrain, saveCharacter, etc.)
    ↓
Data Preparation Agent (enrichment)
    ↓
Data Storage
    ├→ PayloadCMS (structured data)
    ├→ MongoDB (open collections)
    └→ Brain Service (brain.ft.tc - Neo4j + Jina AI)
```

### **Services**
- **brain.ft.tc**: Knowledge graph validation (Neo4j + Jina AI + MCP)
- **tasks.ft.tc**: GPU-intensive task processing (FastAPI + Celery + Redis)

---

## 📝 Documentation Updates

### **Updated Files**
1. ✅ `docs/idea/AI_AGENT_SYSTEM.md`

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Import All Agents**
```typescript
import { allAgents, departmentHeads, specialists } from '@/agents'

// Get all agents
console.log(`Total agents: ${allAgents.length}`)

// Get department heads
console.log(`Department heads: ${departmentHeads.length}`)

// Get specialists by department
console.log(`Story specialists: ${specialists.story.length}`)
```

### **Get Specific Agent**
```typescript
import { getAgentById, getDepartmentHead, getDepartmentSpecialists } from '@/agents'

// Get agent by ID
const storyHead = getAgentById('story-head')

// Get department head
const visualHead = getDepartmentHead('visual')

// Get all specialists for a department
const audioSpecialists = getDepartmentSpecialists('audio')
```

### **Agent Pool Auto-Registration**
```typescript
import { getAgentPool } from '@/lib/agents/pool'

const pool = getAgentPool()
// All 37 agents are automatically registered on initialization
```
