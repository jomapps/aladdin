### 🚧 Known Limitations

#### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution UI (Not Implemented)
- No side-by-side comparison UI for duplicates
- No merge/skip/create actions in UI
- No visual diff highlighting
- Backend duplicate detection fully functional

**Workaround**: Duplicates are returned in API response and can be viewed in console or via API testing tools.

#### Optional Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- File uploader with progress bar (basic upload works)
- Department filter (API supports, UI doesn't)
- Date range filter (API supports, UI doesn't)
- Export functionality
- Background job processing (BullMQ)
- Actual vision model integration (currently mocked)
- Purpose collection (optional user input)
