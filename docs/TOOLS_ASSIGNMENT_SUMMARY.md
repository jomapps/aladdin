# Tools Assignment Summary

## Problem
The agents collection in the database didn't show any tools assigned to agents because the seed data had empty `toolNames: []` arrays for all agents.

## Solution
Updated the `agents.seed.ts` file to assign appropriate custom tools to agents based on their specializations.

3. **Verify in PayloadCMS Admin** - Check that agents now show tools in the admin interface
4. **Test tool execution** - Verify that agents can successfully use their assigned tools
5. **Consider adding more tools** for Video, Audio, and Production departments if needed

## Script Created

A new utility script was created at `src/seed/update-agent-tools.ts` that:
- Updates existing agents in the database with their assigned tools
- Uses direct database update to bypass validation hooks
- Can be re-run safely if needed
- Usage: `npx tsx src/seed/update-agent-tools.ts`

## Update Results

Successfully updated 24 agents:
- 0 errors
- 0 skipped
- All department heads and key specialists now have their tools assigned

## Notes

- Some specialists (especially in Video, Audio, Production) don't have matching custom tools yet
- This is by design - they can be added later as needed
- All department heads have `assess-content-quality` tool for oversight
- Character and Story departments have the most tools due to available custom tools
