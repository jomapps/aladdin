- [ ] `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` is configured (optional)
- [ ] `BRAIN_SERVICE_BASE_URL` is set
- [ ] `BRAIN_SERVICE_API_KEY` is set

### PayloadCMS Agent Setup
- [ ] Create `world-department-agent` in PayloadCMS

    name: "World Department Agent",
    department: "<world-department-id>",
    model: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    isActive: true,
    maxAgentSteps: 20,
    executionSettings: {
      maxRetries: 3,
      retryDelay: 1000
    },
    instructionsPrompt: `You are the World Department Agent...
    
    CRITICAL: Return ONLY a JSON object, no markdown formatting, no code blocks.`
  }
  ```

### Database Collections
- [ ] `agents` collection exists
- [ ] `departments` collection exists
- [ ] `agent-executions` collection exists
- [ ] `story-bible` collection exists
- [ ] World Department document exists

### Dependencies
- [ ] `@codebuff/sdk` installed
- [ ] PayloadCMS configured correctly
- [ ] Gather DB accessible
- [ ] Qualified DB accessible
- [ ] Brain service running

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- world-department-refactor.test.ts
```

- [ ] Agent execution test passes
- [ ] JSON parsing test passes
- [ ] Qualified DB storage test passes
- [ ] PayloadCMS storage test passes
- [ ] Execution tracking test passes
- [ ] Performance metrics test passes
- [ ] Error handling test passes

### Integration Tests

#### 1. Agent Execution
- [ ] Agent fetched successfully from PayloadCMS
- [ ] Agent executes with proper context
- [ ] Story bible generated with all required fields
- [ ] JSON parsing handles string and object outputs
- [ ] Markdown code blocks removed correctly

#### 2. Data Storage
- [ ] Story bible stored in qualified DB
- [ ] Story bible stored in PayloadCMS
- [ ] Correct attribution: "World Department Agent (@codebuff/sdk)"
- [ ] All fields populated correctly

#### 3. Execution Tracking
- [ ] Execution record created with status 'running'
- [ ] Execution record updated with status 'completed'
- [ ] Conversation ID matches pattern: `world-{projectId}`
- [ ] Metadata includes department and data size
- [ ] Events stored correctly
- [ ] Token usage tracked

#### 4. Performance Metrics
- [ ] `totalExecutions` incremented
- [ ] `successfulExecutions` incremented on success
- [ ] `failedExecutions` incremented on failure
- [ ] `averageExecutionTime` calculated correctly
- [ ] `successRate` percentage updated
- [ ] `lastExecutedAt` timestamp updated

#### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Missing agent throws descriptive error
- [ ] Invalid JSON throws parsing error with raw output logged
- [ ] Retry logic kicks in (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- [ ] Error details stored in execution record
- [ ] Agent metrics updated on failure

#### 6. Brain Integration
- [ ] Story bible ingested into brain service
- [ ] Content formatted correctly for embedding
- [ ] Node created with type 'story_bible'
- [ ] Properties include all story bible sections

## Performance Verification

### Expected Improvements
- [ ] Execution tracking overhead < 100ms
- [ ] Retry mechanism working (verify in logs)
- [ ] Token usage tracked accurately
- [ ] Performance metrics updating correctly

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check PayloadCMS for execution records
- [ ] Verify agent performance metrics
- [ ] Monitor token usage and costs
- [ ] Review error logs for issues

## Regression Testing

### Verify No Breaking Changes
- [ ] Story bible structure unchanged
- [ ] Qualified DB schema unchanged
- [ ] PayloadCMS schema unchanged
- [ ] Brain ingestion format unchanged
- [ ] External API remains the same

### Cross-Department Integration
- [ ] World Department still called by evaluation workflow
- [ ] Story bible accessible to other departments
- [ ] Brain queries return correct results

## Production Readiness

### Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Observability
- [ ] Logging adequate for debugging
- [ ] Error messages descriptive
- [ ] Execution tracking working
- [ ] Metrics dashboard configured

### Security
- [ ] No API keys in code
- [ ] Environment variables used correctly
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Rollback Plan

# Remove documentation if needed
rm -rf docs/refactoring/
```
