}
```


## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/nano-banana \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "An action shot of a black lab swimming in an inground suburban swimming pool. The camera is placed meticulously on the water line, dividing the image in half, revealing both the dogs head above water holding a tennis ball in it's mouth, and it's paws paddling underwater."
   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/nano-banana",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "An action shot of a black lab swimming in an inground suburban swimming pool. The camera is placed meticulously on the water line, dividing the image in half, revealing both the dogs head above water holding a tennis ball in it's mouth, and it's paws paddling underwater."
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/nano-banana", {
  input: {
    prompt: "An action shot of a black lab swimming in an inground suburban swimming pool. The camera is placed meticulously on the water line, dividing the image in half, revealing both the dogs head above water holding a tennis ball in it's mouth, and it's paws paddling underwater."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```
