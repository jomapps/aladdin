## Test Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
```typescript
it('should prepare data successfully', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const data = { id: 'test-1', name: 'Test' };
  const options = { projectId: 'proj-1', ... };

  // Act
  const result = await agent.prepare(data, options);

  // Assert
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.type).toBe('character');
});
```

### 2. Error Handling Tests
```typescript
it('should throw error if data is missing', async () => {
  await expect(agent.prepare(null, options))
    .rejects.toThrow('Data is required');
});
```

### 3. Performance Testing
```typescript
it('should complete within time limit', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  await operation();
  const duration = Date.now() - startTime;

  expect(duration).toBeLessThan(1000);
});
```

### 4. Concurrent Testing
```typescript
it('should handle concurrent requests', async () => {
  const promises = items.map(item => process(item));
  const results = await Promise.all(promises);

  expect(results).toHaveLength(items.length);
});
```

### 5. Mock Configuration
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  mockCodebuff.reset();
  mockCodebuff.mockResponse('agent-id', {
    output: { ... },
    status: 'success',
  });
});
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics
| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|

| Batch (50 items) | < 10s | ✅ |
| P95 Latency | < 200ms | ✅ |
| Success Rate | > 95% | ✅ |
| Memory Growth | < 50MB | ✅ |

### Load Testing Results

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out
Increase timeout in vitest.config.mts:
```typescript
test: {
  testTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
}
```

### Memory Issues
Run with more memory:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run test:int
```

### Flaky Tests
Tests are designed to be deterministic. If flaky:
1. Check for race conditions
2. Verify mock configurations
3. Increase timeouts for slow environments

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Collection validation tests (Departments, Agents, AgentExecutions)
- [ ] Quality scoring algorithm tests
- [ ] Real brain service integration tests (optional)
- [ ] WebSocket streaming tests

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing patterns (Arrange-Act-Assert)
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Cover happy path and edge cases
4. Add performance tests for critical paths
5. Update documentation
