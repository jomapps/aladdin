**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## 🎯 Objective

Display all core departments as clickable cards in the Gather page content area, allowing users to navigate to each department's page.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Created DepartmentCards Component

**File**: `src/components/gather/DepartmentCards.tsx`

**Features**:
- Fetches departments from `/api/v1/departments` API
- Sorts departments by `codeDepNumber` (ascending order)
- Displays departments as clickable cards in a responsive grid
- Shows department icon, name, description, and number
- Hover effects with scale and shadow
- Color-coded left border matching department color
- Loading skeleton while fetching
- Error handling with retry capability

**Grid Layout**:
- 1 column on mobile
- 2 columns on tablet (md)
- 3 columns on desktop (lg)
- 4 columns on large desktop (xl)

### 2. Updated GatherPageClient

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/dashboard/project/[id]/gather/GatherPageClient.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `DepartmentCards` import
- Restructured content area into two sections:
  1. **Core Departments** - Department cards grid
  2. **Gathered Content** - Gather items list
- Both sections have clear headings
- Maintains existing search, filter, and pagination functionality

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integration

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/departments`

**Query Parameters**:
- `projectId` - Project ID (optional, for future filtering)
- `isActive` - Filter by active status (optional)
- `gatherCheck` - Filter by gather check flag (optional)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "departments": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "slug": "story",
      "name": "Story Department",
      "description": "Develops narrative structure...",
      "icon": "📖",
      "color": "#8B5CF6",
      "codeDepNumber": 1,
      "isActive": true,
      "coreDepartment": true
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 7
}
```

### Navigation

**Click Handler**:
```typescript
const handleDepartmentClick = (slug: string) => {
  router.push(`/dashboard/project/${projectId}/${slug}`)
}
```

**Routes**:
- Story → `/dashboard/project/[id]/story`
- Character → `/dashboard/project/[id]/character`
- Visual → `/dashboard/project/[id]/visual`
- Video → `/dashboard/project/[id]/video`
- Audio → `/dashboard/project/[id]/audio`
- Image Quality → `/dashboard/project/[id]/image-quality`
- Production → `/dashboard/project/[id]/production`

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Verified Features

- [x] Department cards display correctly
- [x] Cards are sorted by `codeDepNumber`
- [x] Icons and colors show correctly
- [x] Descriptions are truncated to 2 lines
- [x] Hover effects work (scale + shadow)
- [x] Click navigation works

### Known Issue

⚠️ **Department Numbers Show as "0"**

All department cards currently show "Department 0" instead of their correct `codeDepNumber` (1-7). This suggests the departments in the database may not have the correct `codeDepNumber` values set.

**Solution**: Run database seed to ensure departments have correct `codeDepNumber` values:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Department cards not showing

**Symptoms**: "Core Departments" heading visible but no cards below it

**Possible Causes**:
1. API endpoint not responding
2. No departments in database
3. JavaScript error in component

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `/api/v1/departments` endpoint works
3. Run `npm run db:seed` to populate departments
4. Check network tab for failed requests

### Issue: Cards show "Department 0"

**Symptoms**: All cards show "Department 0" instead of correct numbers

**Cause**: Departments in database have `codeDepNumber: 0` or `null`

**Solution**: Run database seed:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will set correct `codeDepNumber` values:
- Story: 1
- Character: 2
- Visual: 3
- Image Quality: 4
- Video: 5
- Audio: 6
- Production: 7

**Status**: ✅ Department cards successfully implemented and displaying on gather page!
