## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov httpx websockets
pnpm install

# Start test services (Docker)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run Python tests (Brain/Celery)
cd services/task-queue && pytest -v --cov

# Run TypeScript tests (PayloadCMS)
pnpm run test:int
pnpm run test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Test Data Fixtures

### High Quality Character (Score ≥ 0.80)
```json
{
  "name": "Sir Aldric Thornwood",
  "backstory": "Born into minor nobility... [500+ words]",
  "traits": ["brave", "scholarly", "conflicted", "determined"],
  "age": 34
}
```

### Low Quality Character (Score < 0.60)
```json
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "backstory": "A guy.",
  "traits": []
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Brain service unavailable during tests | Medium | High | Mock for unit tests, testcontainer for integration |
| Neo4j connection failures | Low | High | Retry logic, connection pooling |
| Flaky async tests | Medium | Medium | Fixed seeds, deterministic mocks |
| Performance regression | Low | High | Automated benchmarks, alerts |
| Test data corruption | Low | Medium | Isolated test databases, cleanup scripts |
