## üêõ Debugging Failed Tests

### Test Fails at Step 1 (Auto-Login)

**Symptoms**: Cannot redirect to dashboard

**Possible Causes**:
- `NODE_ENV` is not set to `development`
- No users exist in database
- PayloadCMS connection issue

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check environment
echo $NODE_ENV  # Should be "development"

# Seed database with users
pnpm db:seed

# Check PayloadCMS connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
```

---

### Test Fails at Step 4 (Evaluate Button Click)

**Symptoms**: Button not found or not clickable

**Possible Causes**:
- Department card not rendering
- Gather data missing
- Department already evaluated

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check gather data exists
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/gather/68df4dab400c86a6a8cf40c6

# Reset evaluation status (if needed)
# Use PayloadCMS admin to delete evaluation record
```

---

### Test Fails at Step 8 (Evaluation Timeout)

**Symptoms**: Evaluation doesn't complete within 2 minutes

**Possible Causes**:
- Task service is down
- AI service timeout
- Webhook not being sent
- Webhook URL incorrect

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check task service health
curl https://tasks.ft.tc/api/v1/health

# Check webhook endpoint
curl https://aladdin.ngrok.pro/api/webhooks/evaluation-complete

# Check task service logs for errors
# Check Next.js logs for webhook notifications

# Verify environment variables
echo $TASKS_API_URL  # Should be https://tasks.ft.tc
echo $TASK_API_KEY   # Should be set
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL  # Should be https://aladdin.ngrok.pro
```

---

### Test Fails at Step 9 (Results Not Displayed)

**Symptoms**: Evaluation completes but results don't show

**Possible Causes**:
- Webhook payload structure mismatch
- Database update failed
- UI not refreshing

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check webhook logs in Next.js console
# Look for: [Webhook] Received evaluation complete notification

# Check database for evaluation record
# Use PayloadCMS admin to view project-readiness collection

# Check browser console for errors
# Open DevTools and look for React errors
```

---

## üìä Test Configuration

**File**: `tests/e2e/evaluation.config.ts`

**Key Settings**:
- **Timeout**: 180 seconds (3 minutes) per test
- **Expect Timeout**: 15 seconds for assertions
- **Workers**: 1 (sequential execution)
- **Retries**: 1 (local), 2 (CI)
- **Screenshots**: Always captured
- **Videos**: Always recorded
- **Traces**: Always captured

**Why Extended Timeouts?**
- AI evaluations can take 30-120 seconds
- Webhook delivery adds latency
- Database updates require time
- UI polling happens every 5 seconds

## üîß Manual Testing

If automated tests fail, you can manually test the flow:

### Step-by-Step Manual Test

1. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Auto-login**: Should redirect to `/dashboard`
3. **Navigate**: Go to `/dashboard/project/68df4dab400c86a6a8cf40c6/gather`
4. **Find Story card**: Look for department card with "Story" title
5. **Click Evaluate**: Press the "Evaluate" button
6. **Verify redirect**: Should go to `/dashboard/project/68df4dab400c86a6a8cf40c6/project-readiness?evaluate=story`
7. **Check toast**: Should see "Starting evaluation for story department..."
8. **Wait**: Evaluation takes 30-120 seconds
9. **Refresh**: Reload page to see updated results
10. **Verify results**: Check rating, summary, issues, suggestions

### Expected Console Logs

**Frontend (Browser Console)**:
```
[ProjectReadiness] Auto-triggering evaluation for: story
[ProjectReadiness] Starting evaluation for department: story
```

**Backend (Next.js Console)**:
```
[TaskService] Submitting evaluation: { url, projectId, taskType }
[TaskService] Response status: 201 Created
[Webhook] Received evaluation complete notification: { task_id, status }
[Webhook] Found evaluation: { id, projectId, departmentId }
[Webhook] Processing completed evaluation: { rating, department }
[Webhook] Updated evaluation record successfully
[Webhook] Updated project readiness score
```

**Task Service (Celery Logs)**:
```
[celery] Task evaluate_department[abc123] received
[celery] Task evaluate_department[abc123] succeeded in 45.2s
[webhook] Sending webhook to https://aladdin.ngrok.pro/api/webhooks/evaluation-complete
[webhook] Webhook delivered successfully: 200 OK
```

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Expected | Acceptable | Concerning |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|
| Task Submission | < 2s | < 5s | > 10s |
| Evaluation Duration | 30-60s | 60-120s | > 180s |
| Webhook Delivery | < 1s | < 3s | > 5s |
| Database Update | < 500ms | < 2s | > 5s |
| UI Refresh | < 1s | < 3s | > 5s |
| **Total Flow** | **45-90s** | **90-180s** | **> 180s** |

---

## üéØ Next Steps

After successful test runs:

1. **Monitor production**: Watch for evaluation failures in production
2. **Tune timeouts**: Adjust based on actual performance
3. **Add more tests**: Cover edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Performance testing**: Load test with multiple concurrent evaluations
5. **Integration tests**: Test all 12 departments sequentially
6. **Regression tests**: Run before each deployment

---

## üìû Support

If tests continue to fail:

1. Check this guide's debugging section
2. Review webhook documentation: `docs/webhooks/EVALUATION_WEBHOOK.md`
3. Review task service docs: `celery-redis/docs/how-to-use-celery-redis.md`
4. Check implementation guide: `docs/celery-redis/need-evaluate-department.md`
5. Review test file: `tests/e2e/evaluation-flow.spec.ts`
