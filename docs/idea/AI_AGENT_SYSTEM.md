## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Agent Architecture** ✅ Implemented
Each agent is implemented using **@codebuff/sdk**:
- **Specialized LLM**: Custom prompts and system instructions
- **Custom Tools**: Domain-specific tools for operations
- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Master → Department Heads → Specialists
- **State Management**: Persistent memory via Brain service
- **Quality Gates**: Input/output validation and consistency checks
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket events to UI

### **Service Architecture** ✅ Operational
| **Service** | **URL** | **Purpose** | **Technology** |
|-------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Brain Service** | brain.ft.tc | Knowledge graph validation | Neo4j + Jina AI + MCP |
| **Task Service** | tasks.ft.tc | Async task processing | BullMQ + Redis + FastAPI |

**Note**: All agents run within the main Next.js application using @codebuff/sdk. No separate domain-specific MCP services are needed.

### **Coordination Patterns**

#### **Sequential Dependencies**
```
Story Bible → Continuity → Quality Controller → Final QC
Voice Creator → Voice Library Manager → Voice Director → Dialogue Delivery → Voice Matching
Storyboard Artist → Image Generation → Video Generation → Video Editor → Compositor
```

#### **Parallel Processing Groups**
- **Character Development**: Character Designer + Voice Creator + Character Arc Manager
- **Visual Design**: Concept Artist + Environment Designer + Costume Designer + Props Master
- **Content Generation**: Image Generation + Video Generation + Animation Director
- **Audio Production**: Voice Director + Sound Designer + Music Composer + Foley Artist

#### **Critical Path Agents** (Must complete before others can proceed)
1. **Series Creator** → All other agents depend on initial concept
2. **Story Architect** → Episode and character development depends on overall arc
3. **Character Creator** → Voice, visual, and casting agents need character profiles
4. **Episode Breakdown** → Scene planning and production agents need episode structure

## 📊 Resource Allocation

### **Agent Instances**
- **Single Instance**: Story Bible, Series Creator, Production Manager
- **Multiple Instances**: Video Generation (per episode), Character Designer (per character)
- **Load Balanced**: Image Generation, Voice Generation, Quality Control

### **Resource Requirements**
- **CPU Heavy**: Text-based agents (Story, Dialogue, Script)
- **GPU Heavy**: Image Generation, Video Generation, Animation
- **Memory Heavy**: Voice Library Manager, Asset Manager, Version Control

### **Coordination Complexity**
- **Low**: Individual creative agents working in isolation
- **Medium**: Cross-department coordination (Visual + Audio)
- **High**: Quality control across all departments, final assembly

## 🎯 Implementation Status

### **Current Status** ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Agent Framework**: ✅ @codebuff/sdk fully integrated and operational
- **Agent Implementation**: ✅ 37 agents configured (1 Master + 7 Dept Heads + 29 Specialists)
- **Coordination**: ✅ Hierarchical coordination working (Master → Dept Heads → Specialists)
- **Quality Control**: ✅ Brain service validation operational (brain.ft.tc)
- **Task Management**: ✅ Async processing operational (tasks.ft.tc)

### **Agent Count by Department**
- **Master Orchestrator**: 1 agent
- **Story Department**: 1 head + 5 specialists = 6 agents
- **Character Department**: 1 head + 1 specialist = 2 agents
- **Visual Department**: 1 head + 5 specialists = 6 agents
- **Video Department**: 1 head + 4 specialists = 5 agents
- **Audio Department**: 1 head + 5 specialists = 6 agents
- **Production Department**: 1 head + 4 specialists = 5 agents
- **Image Quality Department**: 1 head + 5 specialists = 6 agents
- **Total**: 37 agents operational

### **Services Operational**
- **brain.ft.tc**: Knowledge graph validation (Neo4j + Jina AI + MCP)
- **tasks.ft.tc**: Async task processing (BullMQ + Redis + FastAPI)

### **Next Steps**
- Add more specialist agents as needed (framework supports unlimited agents)
- Enhance custom tools for specific workflows
- Optimize agent prompts based on production usage
- Add more department-specific quality gates
- Expand character department specialists
