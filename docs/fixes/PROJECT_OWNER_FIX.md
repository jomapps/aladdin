# Project Owner Validation Error - Fixed

**Issue**: Project creation was failing with validation error: "The following field is invalid: Project Owner"

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

When creating a project through the dashboard:
1. User fills in project details
2. Clicks "Create Project"
3. API returns 500 error: `ValidationError: The following field is invalid: Project Owner`

### Root Cause

The `Projects` collection in PayloadCMS has a **required** `owner` field (line 248 in `src/collections/Projects.ts`):

```typescript
{
  name: 'owner',
  type: 'relationship',
  relationTo: 'users',
  required: true,  // ← This field is required!
  label: 'Project Owner',
}
```

However, the API route (`src/app/api/v1/projects/route.ts`) was **not setting** the `owner` field when creating a project:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Missing owner field
const project = await payload.create({
  collection: 'projects',
  data: {
    name: name.trim(),
    slug,
    logline: description?.trim() || '',
    type,
    genre: genreArray,
    status,
    phase: 'expansion',
    // owner: ??? ← Missing!
  },
})
```

## Solution

### Fix Applied

**File**: `src/app/api/v1/projects/route.ts`

Added the `owner` field to the project creation data, setting it to the authenticated user's ID.

Also improved slug generation using `slugify` + `nanoid` for unique, URL-safe slugs:

```typescript
import slugify from 'slugify'
import { customAlphabet } from 'nanoid'

// Create a nanoid generator with lowercase letters and numbers, 4 characters
const generateId = customAlphabet('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789', 4)

// Create slug from name using slugify + 4-character unique ID
const baseSlug = slugify(name, {
  lower: true,
  strict: true, // Remove special characters
  trim: true,
})

// Ensure slug is not empty (fallback to 'project')
const slug = baseSlug || 'project'

// Make slug unique by appending 4-character ID
const uniqueId = generateId()
const uniqueSlug = `${slug}-${uniqueId}`

// ✅ AFTER - Owner field included + unique slug
const project = await payload.create({
  collection: 'projects',
  data: {
    name: name.trim(),
    slug: uniqueSlug, // ← Unique slug with 4-char ID
    logline: description?.trim() || '',
    type,
    genre: genreArray,
    status,
    phase: 'expansion',
    owner: user.id, // ← Set authenticated user as owner
  },
})
```

### Changes Made

1. **Added `owner: user.id`** to the project creation data
2. The authenticated user (already retrieved at line 15) is now set as the project owner
3. This satisfies the required field validation in PayloadCMS

## Testing

### Manual Test

1. ✅ Login to dashboard
2. ✅ Click "Create Project"
3. ✅ Fill in project details
4. ✅ Click "Create"
5. ✅ Project is created successfully
6. ✅ Project appears in the list

### Automated Test

Created comprehensive E2E test: `tests/e2e/project-creation-flow.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Complete project creation workflow
- ✅ Error handling for validation
- ✅ Cancel functionality
- ✅ Project appears in list after creation

**Run the test**:
```bash
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/project-creation-flow.spec.ts
```

## User Flow

```
1. User logs in
   └─> Dashboard loads

2. User clicks "Create Project"
   └─> Dialog opens

3. User fills in:
   ├─> Project Name (required)
   ├─> Description (optional)
   ├─> Type (default: movie)
   └─> Genre (optional)

4. User clicks "Create"
   └─> POST /api/v1/projects
       ├─> Validates user authentication
       ├─> Validates project name
       ├─> Creates slug from name
       ├─> Sets owner to authenticated user ← FIX APPLIED HERE
       └─> Creates project in PayloadCMS

5. Success!
   ├─> Dialog closes
   ├─> User redirected to project page
   └─> Project appears in list
```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

### 1. Schema Validation
Always check PayloadCMS collection schemas for required fields before creating documents.

### 2. Type Safety
Consider using TypeScript types generated from PayloadCMS schemas:
```typescript
import type { Project } from '@/payload-types'

// This would catch missing required fields at compile time
const projectData: Partial<Project> = {
  name: name.trim(),
  slug,
  // TypeScript would warn if 'owner' is missing
}
```

### 3. Testing
Add E2E tests for all CRUD operations to catch validation errors early.

### 4. Error Messages
Improve error messages to clearly indicate which field is missing:
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  console.error('Error creating project:', error)
  
  // Better error message
  if (error.message?.includes('owner')) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Project owner is required' },
      { status: 400 }
    )
  }
  
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: error.message || 'Failed to create project' },
    { status: 500 }
  )
}
```
